# PointPainting
This repository aims to build an open-source PointPainting package which is easy to understand, deploy and run! We propose to support Kitti dataset first and utilize OpenPCDet as the LiDAR detection framework. We are expected to release the code to support Kitti and at least one semantic segmentation method to do painting by the end of April 2021.
